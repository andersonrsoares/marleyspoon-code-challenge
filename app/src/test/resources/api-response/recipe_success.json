      "description": "Warmer weather means the ushering in of grill season and this recipe completely celebrates the grill (or grill pan)! Squash and green beans are nicely charred then take a bath in a zesty cilantro-jalapeño dressing. After the steaks are perfectly seared, the same dressing does double duty as a tasty finishing sauce. A fresh radish salad tops it all off for crunch and a burst of color. Cook, relax, and enjoy!",
